# Computing-4-Portfolio
The main document titled with my name is the pdf portfolio I wrote in LaTeX for Computing 4 in C++ at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
It includes full source code listings, screen shots of working programs, and some discussion about the implementation of the assignments.
The other PDFs named after the assignments are the assignment descriptions themselves.
Most were derived from Princeton CS department assignments.
